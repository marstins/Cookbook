#Cookbook

Built as my final project for the CS50x course.

This is a web application to help people manage their recipes and, to some extent, their pantries. The goal was to give users a simple, light and intuitive application, that would allow them to create, save and find new recipes, while also being helped when deciding what to cook with what they currently have at their disposal. I took some inspiration from Pinterest, and hoped it would be a social application of sorts, although not to the same extent as a Twitter or Instagram.

My next goal for this project is to host it, and make it available for the general public. After that, there are some improvements in regards to UI and a few questions regarding authorship that need answering. 

It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and Sqlite.
